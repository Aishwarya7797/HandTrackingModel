A null reference can be stored in a node. Lists of nodes can be as long as they want, limited only by the heap's free memory.The Node class is used to build a node object. This allows us to access the nodes individually and include elements such as the parent node and next node. This allows us to calculate the least cost function. The position aids in determining the route or path that the function must follow. If the Parent node is \"None,\" the Maze's beginning node is said to be \"None.\""
